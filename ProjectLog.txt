ROLE SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------
Member 1: Tuan Thanh Nguyen
- Primary role: Application developer / MySQL integration
- Implemented Database.cs facade and DbConnectionFactory.cs for connecting to MySQL using ADO.NET.
- Implemented StudentRepository and ProgramRepository (CRUD operations, parameterized queries).
- Implemented full CRUD in the UI for Student and Program entities against the MySQL database and in-memory CRUD for the other tables.
- Added transaction control for student deletion (cascading delete of CourseEnrollment before deleting Student).

Member 2: George Shapka
- Primary role: Data modeling, ERD, and database design.
- Built and refactored the WPF UI (MainWindow.xaml + MainWindow.xaml.cs) with tabs for Students, Programs, Courses, ProgramCourse, Instructors, CourseOfferings, CourseEnrollments, and InstructorAssignments.
- Defined the project use case (CourseRegPro – course registration management system).
- Identified main entities, attributes, and relationships for the system (Student, Program, Course, CourseOffering, Instructor, CourseEnrollment, InstructorAssignment, ProgramCourse).
- Created the ERD using [tool name, e.g., draw.io / Lucidchart] and ensured all keys and relationships matched the business rules.
- Helped align the ERD with the final MySQL schema implemented in the DDL script.

Member 3: Toro-Abasi Udo
- Primary role: Normalization and DDL implementation.
- Produced the normalization report, showing each table from 1NF → 2NF → 3NF and explaining how redundancies and partial/transitive dependencies were removed.
- Wrote the MySQL DDL script (Phase 4) to create CourseRegProDB with all tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- Verified referential integrity between tables and updated the schema according to feedback from Phases 2 and 3.
- Assisted with initial test data and validation of CRUD operations against the MySQL schema.
